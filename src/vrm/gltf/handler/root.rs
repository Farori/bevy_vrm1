//! `on_root`: the root-level VRM extensions, parsed into the per-load state.
//!
//! The extension JSON is read straight off the [`gltf::Gltf`] the hook is
//! handed — `gltf::Document::extensions()` and friends — because a handler never
//! sees bevy's [`Gltf`] asset and therefore cannot use
//! [`VrmExtensions`](crate::vrm::gltf::extensions::VrmExtensions). The schemas
//! themselves are the crate's shared ones
//! ([`vrmc_vrm::VrmcVrm`], [`vrmc_spring_bone::VRMCSpringBone`]), so a file
//! parses identically on both the legacy and the pipeline path, and there is no
//! second set of VRM structs to keep in sync.
//!
//! # `VRMC_vrm_animation` is deliberately *not* a model root
//!
//! VRM 0.0 files put their model extensions under the name `VRMC_vrm_animation`,
//! which the legacy loader's
//! [`obtain_vrmc_vrm`](crate::vrm::gltf::extensions::obtain_vrmc_vrm) accepts as
//! a fallback. This loader does not: `VRMC_vrm_animation-1.0` is the root of a
//! `.vrma` file, whose `expressions` map holds *node references*
//! (`{"happy": {"node": 5}}`) where `VRMC_vrm` holds expression *definitions*.
//! Both deserialize into `VrmcVrm` — the reference parses as an empty
//! expression — so accepting the name would silently turn every `.vrma` file
//! loaded through the legacy [`VrmaLoaderPlugin`](crate::vrm::loader::VrmLoaderPlugin)
//! into a VRM scene with no expressions. Only `VRMC_vrm` marks a file as a VRM.
