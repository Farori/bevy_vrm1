//! Components the glTF extension handler writes into the scene `WorldAsset`
//! while a `.vrm` / `.vrma` file loads.
//!
//! Everything here is produced *inside* bevy's `GltfLoader`, before the scene
//! world is serialized into the asset, which imposes two rules on every type in
//! this module:
//!
//! * It must derive `Reflect` with `#[reflect(Component)]` and be handed to
//!   [`App::register_type`](bevy::app::App::register_type), because the scene
//!   spawn pipeline copies components out of the asset through reflection. An
//!   unregistered type is dropped, not copied.
//! * Any component holding an [`Entity`] must mark that field `#[entities]`.
//!   Entity ids minted in the loader's scratch world mean nothing once the asset
//!   is instantiated, so an unremapped reference is not a harmless no-op but a
//!   dangling read into a different scene's entities.
//!
//! # Why `#[entities]` and not `#[derive(MapEntities)]`
//!
//! `#[derive(Component)]` turns every `#[entities]` field into a
//! `Component::map_entities`
//! implementation, and that is the hook bevy 0.19 calls when it instantiates a
//! `WorldAsset`:
//! `ReflectComponent::apply_or_insert_mapped` runs
//! `C::map_entities(&mut component, &mut mapper)` for every copied component
//! (`bevy_ecs/src/reflect/component.rs:340`, `:345`, `:353`), and it is
//! `world_asset.rs:192` that invokes it while spawning. The standalone
//! [`MapEntities`](bevy::ecs::entity::MapEntities) trait is a separate impl
//! that this path never consults — only `#[reflect(MapEntities)]` type data
//! would reach it — so deriving it would compile and then do nothing.
//!
//! Node identity is by glTF node index ([`VrmNodeIndex`]), never by
//! [`Name`]: glTF node names are optional and routinely collide inside one file.
//!
//! # First/third-person render layers
//!
//! The helpers at the bottom of this module split the two camera views while
//! both cameras still render ordinary layer-0 scene content.
//!
//! The scheme is forced by bevy's semantics: visibility is a plain bitwise AND
//! over the layer set (`RenderLayers::intersects`, used at
//! `bevy_camera/src/visibility/mod.rs:809` and
//! `bevy_pbr/src/render/mesh.rs:2294`). There is no exclusion, so **two sets
//! separate only if they share no layer at all**. Putting [`LAYER_BOTH`] on a
//! "…only" mesh set therefore makes that set intersect *every* camera that also
//! carries [`LAYER_BOTH`] — which is exactly what an ordinary scene camera has —
//! and the separation collapses. The exclusive mesh sets must therefore carry
//! their layer alone, which is why they are `{1}` and `{2}` and not `{0, 1}` /
//! `{0, 2}`. `render_layer_helpers_pin_the_visibility_matrix` pins the matrix.
//!
//! # The light obligation, and how it is discharged
//!
//! A mesh on layer 1 or 2 alone is *directly lit* by a layer-0 light as usual:
//! bevy 0.19.1 does not filter direct lighting by mesh layers. A light is
//! gathered per **view** (`bevy_camera/src/visibility/mod.rs:809` via
//! `ViewVisibility`; directional lights additionally filtered against the view's
//! layers at `bevy_pbr/src/render/light.rs:1804`), and cluster assignment
//! compares a clusterable object against the **view's** layers, not the light's
//! (`bevy_light/src/cluster/assign.rs:459`). Even `RectLight` carries a TODO for
//! the missing per-light filtering (`bevy_pbr/src/render/light.rs:1977`).
//!
//! What *is* filtered light-vs-mesh is **shadow casting**: `queue_shadows` skips
//! a mesh when the light's layers do not intersect the mesh's
//! (`bevy_pbr/src/render/light.rs:2633-2636`). So a default layer-0 light would
//! leave the split-off head copies out of every shadow map.
//!
//! Rather than leave that as a trap, [`VrmLightLayersPlugin`] widens lights that
//! carry no explicit layers to [`all_vrm_render_layers`], so a plain light lights
//! and shadows the exclusive meshes without the user doing anything. The
//! trade-off it cannot remove: a light whose layers the user sets explicitly is
//! left strictly alone, and that light will not shadow the exclusive meshes
//! unless its layers include 1 and 2.
