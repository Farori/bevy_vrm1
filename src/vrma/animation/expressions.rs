//! Retargeting a `.vrma`'s expression tracks onto the load-time expression shape.
//!
//! # What a `.vrma` says
//!
//! `VRMC_vrm_animation.expressions` maps a glTF **node** to each expression the
//! clip animates, split into `preset` and `custom`. The animation of such a node
//! is a plain glTF `translation` channel, and the spec fixes the encoding: **the
//! X component of the translation is the expression's weight**, and a value
//! outside `[0, 1]` must be clamped into it.
//!
//! So a `.vrma` "expression track" is a `Vec3` curve whose `y` and `z` are
//! unused, which is exactly why it cannot be played as-is. Retargeting it means
//! turning one `Transform::translation` curve into one `f32` curve bound to
//! `ExpressionWeightProperty`, which writes the avatar root's
//! `VrmExpressionWeights`. `apply_expression_morph_binds`, scheduled by
//! `VrmGltfPlugin`, then distributes those weights into the bound `MorphWeights`
//! — there is no per-expression entity and no separate runtime expression pass.
//!
//! # Where the clamp of `[0, 1]` happens
//!
//! The spec requires an out-of-range weight to be clamped into `[0, 1]`, and
//! `apply_expression_morph_binds` does exactly that for every weight it reads,
//! animated or triggered (`expression_output_weight`). The keyframes written here
//! are therefore left verbatim: clamping them would introduce a kink at the
//! crossing, and a resampled kink is smeared across the surrounding samples —
//! which is precisely where an `isBinary` expression's `0.5` threshold would then
//! be decided on a value the file never wrote.
//!
//! # Where the curves come from
//!
//! [`retarget_expression_curves`] runs per `.vrma` instance, inside the same
//! `RequestUpdateAnimationClips` step that moves the humanoid bone curves onto
//! the avatar (`crate::vrma::animation::animation_graph`). Every destination
//! curve it writes therefore ends up in the *same* `AnimationClip` asset, which
//! is what `AnimationGraph::from_clips` turns into a single clip node and
//! `PlayVrma` plays with one `RepeatAnimation` — expression and bone playback
//! cannot drift apart, and there is no second player to keep in sync.
//!
//! # Per-avatar isolation
//!
//! Three independent things make two avatars playing the same `.vrma` file keep
//! separate faces:
//!
//! * the destination target is [`vrm_root_animation_target`], a *component* on
//!   each avatar root (`handler::scene::setup_animation`), so bevy resolves it
//!   per instance instead of sharing one evaluated value;
//! * what lands there is keyed by `ExpressionWeightProperty::new(name)`'s
//!   interned name, and the destination is each avatar's own
//!   `VrmExpressionWeights` map;
//! * the graph, the player and the per-instance cloned clip all live on the
//!   avatar, so one avatar stopping its clip cannot freeze another's face.
//!
//! The one thing that *is* shared is the curve's immutable keyframe data, which
//! is exactly what a shared `AnimationClip` asset is for.
//!
//! # Precedence against user triggers
//!
//! `SetExpressions` / `ModifyExpressions` write `VrmExpressionWeights` from
//! wherever the caller triggers them — in practice `Update`. bevy's
//! `animate_targets` runs later, in `PostUpdate`, and writes the same map. The
//! animation therefore wins **while its clip is playing**, and the bind pass
//! (`add_expression_bind_pass`, ordered `.after(AnimationSystems)`) sees the
//! animated value. A trigger is still how a user overrides the face: name only
//! the expressions the clip does not drive, or stop the clip — see
//! [`reset_expression_weights`].
